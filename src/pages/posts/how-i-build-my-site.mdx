# Introduction

I'm always passionate about creating better portfolio website. This is the third version since I'm graduated.

The first version is using outdated tech stack and I want to learn something new so I decided to create the next version.

The second version has performance improvement, thanks to gatsby. Unfortunately, it doesn't has my profile there because I designed it specifically for blog posting.

Here's the third one. It combines everything: performance, my profile, blog post, lean, and simple.

# How does it look?

I have no idea why you haven't seen it yet.

# Tech stack

## 1. Gatsby

Reasons:
- Good performance
- Perfect for blog posting with markdown
- Good separation of concern. Data source, data parsing, and ui components are beautifully separate.
- Powerful query system. It uses graphql to fetch data to generate static content so it's very dynamically. It can even use 1 yaml file to render the whole website.

## 2. Mdx

Reasons:
- Highly flexible. It's able to import custom component inside .mdx file so I can have full control without spending too much effort on low-value code.
